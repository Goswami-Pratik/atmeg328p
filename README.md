# The [atmeg328p](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf) Exploration Project

#### The [atmeg328p](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf) is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVRÂ® enhanced RISC architecture. 
By executing powerful instructions in a single n a single clock cycle, the ATmega328P achieves throughputs approaching 1MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus processing speed.

The repository contains simple scripts that explore the microcontroller's architecture and its functionality.
